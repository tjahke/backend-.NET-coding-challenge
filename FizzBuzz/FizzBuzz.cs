/**
 *
 * Given is the following FizzBuzz application which counts from 1 to 100 and outputs either the corresponding
 * number or the corresponding text if one of the following rules apply.
 * Rules:
 *  - dividable by 3 without a remainder -> Fizz
 *  - dividable by 5 without a remainder -> Buzz
 *  - dividable by 3 and 5 without a remainder -> FizzBuzz
 *
 * ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
 * Please refactor this code so that it can be easily extended in the future with other rules, such as
 * "if it is dividable by 7 without a remainder output Bar"
 * "if multiplied by 10 is larger than 100 output Foo"
 *
